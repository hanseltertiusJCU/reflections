How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It is to spot the difference between two codes easily and when something was mistyped(typo), 
	you can spot it easily and working to fix it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It is to look at the development process of the program and able to spot the errors more easily. 
	From the statement, we can fix the error without having to use a lot of effort.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The good thing about manually choosing when to create a commit is 
	we have the freedom to choose the best time to commit and 
	we might have easier time to spot the bug. 
	However, the process of version control is slower than automatically saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git doesn't save the versions automatically when we want to do one file at a time. 
	Besides, Git has the ability to track multiple files that makes this version control 
	to be able to save multiple files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The command git log is used for viewing all the commit that is done by a project 
	(can be single or multiple files). 
	Meanwhile, the command git diff is used to compare one commit to another.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is to be able to identify the problem more easily by looking at the description.
	Besides, version control enables more organized development that enables the user
	to provide the solution easier or to get much-needed freedom to develop the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will use Git for version control in order for me to have the neccesary freedom to develop my code
