When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is used for collaborative project (project that involve group work rather than individual). 
Besides, GitHub enables on sharing the work publicly that can be seen by anyone compared to keeping all your work local
that can only be seen by an individual.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It it to make every contents of local repository to be the same as the remote repository.
Besides, we are controlling the repository instead of computer that causes the version control to be more accurate instead of 
being controlled by computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks used when someone wants to make their own remote repository based on another person's remote repository
 in GitHub without changing the content of another person's repository itself.
  Clones used when someone wants to clone the remote repository from GitHub to the local repository, which is the
working directory of the targeted computer.
  Branches used when someone wants to make another version of file in the local repository without changing the contents
of the master branch itself. Besides, it is to be treated as a content that we try to push from the local repository into the
remote repository (occurs on GitHub).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
It enables us to be able to fetch the contents of the remote repository to the local repository
that makes us to be able to merge remote changes to the local repository.
